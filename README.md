# User List Component Documentation

This document provides an overview and documentation for the `UserList` component, which is responsible for fetching and displaying a list of users from an API endpoint.

## Component Overview

The `UserList` component is a React functional component implemented using React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`). It fetches a list of users from a specified API endpoint and renders them in a table format.

## Component Functionality

The `UserList` component performs the following tasks:

1. **State Management**: It manages the state of the user data using the `useState` hook. The `users` state variable holds an array of user objects.

2. **Data Fetching**: It utilizes the `useEffect` hook to perform a side effect, which is fetching the user data from the API when the component mounts. The `fetchUsers` function, an asynchronous function, uses Axios to make a GET request to the API endpoint (`https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1&per_page=6`). Upon successful retrieval of the data, it updates the `users` state with the response data.

3. **Rendering**: It renders the list of users in a table format. Each user is represented as a row in the table, with columns for user ID, email, first name, last name, and avatar. It maps over the `users` array and generates table rows (`<tr>`) for each user, populating the table cells (`<td>`) with user data.
